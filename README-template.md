## My process

### Built with

- HTML (body, div, img and a) elements
-  CSS (margin,padding fonts,colors,border-raduis and many more)
- Media queries
 
### What I learned
I learnt how to use media queries and how to center an element

```css
@media screen
    and (max-device-width: 640px) {
  .main {
    width: 50%;
     margin-top: 150px;
  }
}
```
